<h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
<p>HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It's basically what the web browsers use to request or deliver web pages. </p>
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. It's the code that structures and displays content on the web browser.</p>
<h2>Describe the process of requesting a web page from a web server.</h2>
<p>For anything to happen, the user needs to type in a URL into the web browser. The web server, which acts as a special computer that is constantly connected to the internet, will be optimized to send web pages out to the user who requested it.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between a regular tag and an empty tag?</h2>
<p>An opening tag, like the ones I'm using to type this Q and A out, have an opening and closing version. Empty tags do not use a closing half, which is the part at the end where there is a tag containing a slash.</p>
<h2>What does white space collapsing mean?</h2>
<p>This just means that the extra spaces and line breaks in the HTML output or preview are reduced to a single line space.</p>
